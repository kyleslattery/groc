A simple Sinatra app to nicely display a Git repository of documentation files.  The aim is to be able to point it at a Git repository formatted in something like Markdown, and it nicely formats the files and displays them.  You'll also be able to view past revisions, etc.

I'm also hoping to make it accept Github hooks, so that it'll auto update the repository.
